# What I found interesting about the article
The article opened up with some solid points regarding the nature of the industry and how easy it can be to feel insufficient or incapable because successful people get covered so often. It followed up with a few pointers to get over imposter syndrome, such as recognizing why we might feel that way, and then understanding that there is just too much knowledge in the field for any one person to fully understand and use, so it's perfectly fine not to know things. I also really liked their advice to just treat that as a good thing, since we will always be able to keep learning. The benefit of working with other people is that we can learn from them every day, and work together to do things that individuals would struggle to do. Learning is part of the career and we have to accept that.
